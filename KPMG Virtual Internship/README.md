The virtual internship helped me gain some relevant skills and also gave me an insight into how the data analytics team works at KPMG. During this Internship, I have learned how to:

Review and identify the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.
Analyse their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behavior. Specifically, different approaches such as data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results in interpretation, and reporting are utilized.
Develop a dashboard that displays the data summary and results of the analysis to present to the client.
